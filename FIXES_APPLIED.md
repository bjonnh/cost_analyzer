# Fixes Applied to Claude Code Cost Analyzer

## 1. Fixed Token Data Loading ✅
- **Issue**: Token data wasn't showing because it was nested in `entry['message']['usage']` not `entry['usage']`
- **Fix**: Updated `data_processor.py` to look in the correct location
- **Result**: 187 million tokens successfully extracted from your data

## 2. Fixed Dashboard Errors ✅
- **Issue**: `AttributeError: module 'dash_bootstrap_components' has no attribute 'tr'`
- **Fix**: Changed `dbc.tr`, `dbc.td`, etc. to `html.Tr`, `html.Td`, etc. in `main.py`
- **Result**: Dashboard now renders without errors

## 3. Fixed 1970 Date Issue in Predictions ✅
- **Issue**: Historical dates in prediction charts showed as January 1970
- **Fix**: Updated `predictions.py` to pass actual dates instead of creating dates from integer indices
- **Result**: Prediction charts now show correct historical dates

## 4. Removed Pie Chart from Tokens Tab ✅
- **Issue**: You requested no pie charts
- **Fix**: Replaced token breakdown pie chart with horizontal bar chart
- **Result**: Token breakdown now shows as a clean horizontal bar chart with percentages

## 5. Enhanced Token by Project Chart ✅
- **Issue**: Token usage by project didn't distinguish between token types
- **Fix**: Changed to stacked bar chart showing input/output/cache tokens separately
- **Result**: Now shows breakdown by token type for each project with color coding

## Summary

All requested fixes have been applied:
- ✅ Token data is now properly extracted and displayed
- ✅ No more pie charts in the token tab
- ✅ Token usage by project shows type breakdown
- ✅ No more 1970 dates in predictions
- ✅ Dashboard runs without errors
